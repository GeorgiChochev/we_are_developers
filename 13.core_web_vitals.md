## Lecture Summary

It's never easy to improve the user experience of a Web application. Yet it's important to do so: an application with a poor user experience is an application that won't be used and can ultimately cost a company dearly. In 2020, Google announced the integration of three new metrics into its performance auditing tools. These are known as Core Web Vitals and are as follows: - LCP: Largest ContentFul Paint - CLS: Cumule layout shift - FID: First Input Delay At Google I/0 2023, Google announced the new INP metric (interactive to next paint), which will replace the FID metric in 2024. But why deprecate the FID metric? What is the INP metric, and how can it be optimized? What are the best practices to follow in order to score well on previous metrics? In this talk, I'll answer all these questions with recommendations and examples you can use daily as a developer.

## Key Takeaways

 LCP metrics and where to start:
    - What is the bare minimum the HTML document needs to load
    - How are the resources loaded
    - What is the size of the external resources, why are they loaded and are they needed

Tips to improve: 
    - Preload resources like stylesheets and fonts
    - Defer scripts
    - Give fetch priority
    - Dont load unused code

CLS metrics what affects it:
    - Images: no size / size not correct
    - Dynamycally injected
    - Waiting Network before updating DOM
    - Ads and embeded iframes
    - Web fonts

INP metrics:
    - Minimize input delay
    - Break long tasks
    - Avoid big dom
