## Lecture Summary

If we mention to write documentation, this goes very often with some rolling eyes ðŸ™„ as documenting is considered to be one of the least attractive tasks. Learn in this session not only why complete documentation (no, inline comments are not sufficient) matters, but how changing your view and approach of writing the docs can lead to a better understanding of your app, easier onboarding for your team, smoother delivery, and better user-experience. Luise will provide you with some eye-opening insights on the why, how and what of proper documentation.

## Key Takeaways

 - Types of dev documentation
    - Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
      - Describes a software system to be built
      - Lays out functional and non-functional requirements
      - Includes a set of use cases
    - Source code documentation
      - Comments where needed and where code by itself is not self-evident
      - Release Notes
    - UX designer documentation
      - UX design is part of the product design
      - It begins at the requirements stage and proceeds through all the stages of development, including testing and post-release stages
      - UX documentation covers
        - user personas
        - user scenarios
        - user story maps
        - a UX style guide, which includes an accessibility guide as well
    - API documentation
    - Software design description
      - Contains the software design and overall architecture
      - Keeps the whole team on the same page
      - Helps to ensure that all stakeholders vet the entire design and that all risks and assumptions are considered
    - Test documentation
    - Product roadmap
      - Contains a plan of action for how a product will evolve over 23:51
      - Serves as a guide for both business and technical teams
      - "The big picture"
  - Why we need docs?
    - Software success
      - Meet cost, quality and time constraints
      - Not well-defined requirements and not identified risks increase likelihood of redesign later on
      - Well defined requirements and risk awareness increase probability that project satisfies budget, quality and time
    - Unify Product-Related-Information
      - Information that is scattered is hard to find and easy to lose
      - A central repository of all product-related Information helps developers and other stakeholders find the required information quickly
    - Facilitate Knowledge Sharing
    - Improve Future Projects
      - Lessons learned during software development projects can help teams improve their work on future projects
      - In this way time and cost will be saved and quality improves
    - Consistency  
      - Well documented code can help maintain consistency throughout the project
      - Developers adhere to the same conventions and design patterns
      - Resulting in cleaner more standardized code
    - Saves time and effort
      - Writing docs requires time and effort upront
      - it saves more time in the long run
      - it reduces the need of developers to figure out what the software does or how to use it
    - Future proofing
      - documentation can help during planning for future iterations of the software
      - By knowing the current state of the application in detail the developers can more effectively plan for new feature and changes
