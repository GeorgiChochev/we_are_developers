## Lecture Summary

Imagine a world where frontend frameworks would have no dependency conflicts, no outdated libraries and no security issues. A world where the gap between frontend and backend is finally closed. Only one deployment is needed and only one service must run. A framework that lets you focus on HTML, with no boiler plate in between. No JSON & GraphQL, no serialization, no virtual DOM. Easy to understand and maintain - packed with much higher performance than any existing Javascript framework. And the best part? You have the freedom to choose your backend and preferred typed language. Presenting: HTMX, the new approach in writing web applications. In this session, we'll show you how simple building an e-commerce shop can be. Using Kotlin, Spring Boot, and plain Tailwind, we'll demonstrate key features that make HTMX a revolutionary approach in writing web applications. Join us to see HTMX in action and explore its potential to transform your web development experience.

## Key Takeaways

Unlike the typical JSON responses, HTMX returns pure HTML to the client, enabling backend-driven components.
