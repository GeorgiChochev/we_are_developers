## Lecture Summary

How microservices become autonomous services. Microservices have been used more and more frequently in recent years. The use of many smaller services has made the use of synchronous communication increasingly difficult and complex. This is because synchronous communication ensures close coupling between the individual services and can ensure that if one service fails, a number of others fail at the same time. Typical resilience patterns such as: Circuit-Breaker, Retries, Service Meshes, etc. in turn increase the complexity of the overall system and also only partially solve the real problem. In this presentation, I will show how an event-first mindset can be used to design entire systems in an event-driven way. How microservices become autonomous services that are completely separate from each other and only communicate with each other via events. And how developers can use serverless and FaaS to focus on what is important: delivering business value.

## Key Takeaways

 - Traditional microservices architecture (request-driven) can lead to tight coupling and cascading failures.
 - Event-driven architecture promotes loose coupling and asynchronous communication between services.
 - Event notification pattern uses simple messages to inform about events, but may require additional data requests.
 - Event-carried state transfer includes all necessary data in the event, reducing dependencies but requiring versioning.
 - Event sourcing stores all state changes as a sequence of events, providing traceability and flexibility.

## Applicability

Event-driven architecture is particularly suitable for building scalable, resilient, and flexible microservices systems.
It's especially valuable in scenarios where services need to operate independently and adapt to changing requirements over time.
However implementation requires careful planning to manage data consistency, event modeling, and system performance.
This is something I believe we already kinda utilise with the Chat/Impulse which lately seems robust though hard to maintain?
