## Lecture Summary

For the past two years, reports on emerging technologies have shown a strong evolution toward composable architectures. A best-in-class composable architecture, cloud-based, consists of a set of reusable building blocks. These blocks can be custom-developed or built with the best in the market off-the-shelf SaaS blocks. A composable architecture pushes the boundaries of micro-services, allowing for greater agility, faster implementation, and improved user experience through strong modularity. But all those benefits are real only if your implementation is done the right way.
