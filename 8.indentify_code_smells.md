## Lecture Summary

Code smells occur in the source code of an application and can indicate deeper problems that are not apparent at first glance. Identifying and fixing these issues helps tremendously in securing and future-proofing the application under development and allows developers and testers to better understand, maintain, extend, and test the code. Recognizing code smells can help in estimating the effort required for certain tasks, assessing the quality of work, and making informed decisions about refactoring. It can also aid in identifying potential risks and bottlenecks early in the development cycle, thereby saving time and resources in the long run. In this session I will go through the different categories of code smells and explain each one with example code. Also, I will explain why it is good to know and be able to name different code smells even if you donâ€™t do any programming yourself.
