## Lecture Summary

Embark on a journey into the cutting-edge world of web development with Astro.build, the speed-driven, all-in-one web framework that's redefining the way we build for the web. Imagine a framework where "component islands" seamlessly integrate, and the default is "zero JS" — welcome to Astro 4.10! Join me in this talk as we unravel the basics behind Astro and explore its native support for popular UI frameworks like React, Preact, Svelte, Solid, and more. We'll deep dive into real-world use cases, focusing predominantly on the React ecosystem—covering routing, components, and other exciting features. But that's not all! Witness the magic unfold as we update our presentation slides live using Astro and we try a live test deployment during the presentation — with fingers crossed for the favor of the demo gods. Fasten your seatbelts, and let's propel your projects into the stratosphere with Astro!

## Key Takeaways

- Astro is designed for simplicity, speed and flexability
- Ships Zero Javascript by default
- Astro Islands 
  - allowing to ship javascript to only specific parts/components
  - Parallel loading of different components
- Has a bit weird syntax
- Also directives that manage how a component loads are a thing
- Can use React, Vue, etc internally to build your components
- Can build static pages from markdown
- Can be somewhat easy to customize Astro and build own integrations for bootstraping apps quickly?
