## Lecture Summary

The web platform is evolving quickly, with User Interface features to improve developer experiences, create new responsive capabilities, and enable more accessible interface defaults. The aim of this talk is to give a high level overview of what you can get excited about in the User Interface space and look out for on the web platform for CSS and HTML, as we take a look at some of the most exciting and impactful features that landed recently or are coming soon to modern browsers. This talk will include demos and code snippets of the new features released by the Chromium team.

## Key Takeaways

 - `:has` A powerful CSS selector enabling parent, child, and sibling selections.
 - `Text-wrap: balance:` A new way to achieve better text alignment across multiple lines.
 - `Color-gamut:` Extending beyond sRGB for a richer color palette.
 - `CSS Nesting:` Similar to SCSS nesting but native to CSS.
 - `Customizable Form Controls:` Enhanced styling for elements like <select> and <option>.
 - `Popover:` A native popover implementation with built-in accessibility features.

## Applicability

Applying already some of these features could be beneficial
 - Potentially refactoring the dialogs using the `Popover`
 - Writing easier css selectors using `:has`
