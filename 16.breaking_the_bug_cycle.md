## Lecture Summary

lopment of web APIs (highlighting the Fugu project), the gap between Progressive Web Apps (PWA), hybrid development approaches, and native apps has been progressively narrowing. Even visually, they are hardly distinguishable from native apps. However, when it comes to animations, native apps have always had an edge due to the availability of native animation APIs. Complex animations, such as container transforms, were practically challenging to achieve in web apps without significant effort. That's right. They WERE. This gap can be closed thanks to the new View Transition API and Scroll-Driven Animations. And the best part is that it is almost entirely through CSS. Intrigued? Sascha Lehmann from Thinktecture will provide an overview of these new APIs, how to effectively implement them in your project, and their limitations.
