## Lecture Summary

Have you ever felt bogged down by the complexities of state management in React? You're not alone. State management is pivotal in defining user experience and application functionality, but it often becomes a labyrinth of complexity, especially with libraries like Redux and Recoil. While these tools have their merits, they can overwhelm boilerplate code, slowing development and steepening the learning curve for new and seasoned developers. In this talk, we will explore alternative tools using React's built-in features and demonstrate how to harness the power of hooks and the Context API to handle complex state management, minimizing overhead and reducing the need for additional dependencies. In this talk, we will introduce the concept of state transformers, which simplifies state updates and transformations within React applications. By the end of this talk, you will gain a fresh perspective on React state management and how to utilize React's built-in tools.

## Key Takeaways

It encourages the usage of the built-in react state mgmt hooks like the 'React.Context' API
which is fine for small projects but i think other solutions are still more effective
