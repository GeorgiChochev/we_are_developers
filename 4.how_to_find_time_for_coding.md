## Lecture Summary

Another day spent at work and you did a million things, none of which lived on your to do list? If you share the frustration of not finding enough time for coding, steal my tried and tested methods to find time. My calendar is insanely filled, most days with double and triple bookings. I currently work as a team coach to four teams, all of which operate in parallel 2-week-sprints. If I can find time for cognitively challenging work, you can do it, too. My methods involve one strategic secret, overcoming FOMO and the consistent use of a famous tomato.
