## Lecture Summary

Function components on React introduced hooks, a completely different approach to how you deal with the component lifecycle. This has led to many discussions on when and where to use hooks. What values should be memoized with useMemo? When is needed useCallback? What should go in the dependency array? Why using useReducer if it does the same as useState? This talk tries to give a swallow look at the trade-offs of using different callbacks and advice on when to use them, with practical examples.

## Key Takeaways

TODO: add examples

### Dos
  - Extract utils from components
  - Do use intermediate variables
  - use useState function form
  - Share functionality with custom hook

### Donts
  - Don't overthink performance
  - Don't infer
  - Don't store a state if it shouldn't re-render
