## Lecture Summary

This talk focuses on Next.js, the hyped JavaScript framework developed by Vercel. Specifically, I address how Next.js features such as Image Optimization and Dynamic Imports impact practical applications. To do this, I measure the web vitals of a sample application and optimize them using Next.js features. By this, we will find out of what specific benefits individual optimizations in our new favorite frontend framework have and what we should focus on. Come & join if you want to gain practical insights and actionable strategies for maximizing website performance and user engagement through the lens of Next.js and Web Vitals!

## Key Takeaways

We've looked into the following performance metrics
 - Time to First Byte
 - First content painful
 - Largest content paintful
 - First input delay
 - Comulative layout shift
 - Interaction to next paint
 - Lighthouse performance scores

NextJS specific optimizations:
 - Image optimization using <Image />
 - 3rd party Script optimizations using <Script />
 - Import optimizations using dynamic imports
 - Better font loading

```tsx
import { Playfair_Display as Playfair } from 'next/font/google';

export const playfair_init = Playfair({
  weigth: ["400"],
  subset: ["latin"],
  display: "swap",
  variable: "--font-playfair"
})

export const playfair = playfair_init.variable;
```

## Applicability

We are already taking advantage of some of these optimization options in our NextJS apps
One notable topic is the font optimization and could prove to be somewhat useful for our usecase
